# 2024â€“2025 Sorbonne University

In this version of IMUNES, we introduced full integration of Kubernetes using KIND (Kubernetes IN Docker).  
This integration allows users to design, deploy, and emulate Kubernetes clusters directly within the IMUNES environment, alongside traditional network elements (routers, switches, etc.).

Additional improvements include:
- Support for master/worker Kubernetes topology modeling.
- Automated cluster creation and deletion.
- Visual and interactive node configuration.
- Pre-installed networking tools (ping, tcpdump, iperf3, etc.) in KIND nodes.
- Enhanced container-based emulation for Kubernetes environments.
